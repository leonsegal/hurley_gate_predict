# Hurley Weir - Gate Predictor
A project to predict how many gates will be open at Hurley Weir

## Background
As a freestyle kayaker, I wanted to be able to predict how many gates would be open at Hurley Weir. Some research had already been done by other kayakers to see how many gates were open and they corresponded to the actual river level (readings supplied by the rowing club at Maidenhead). From here, I 'automagicked' the process, taking the data from the EA API and feeding that into my app.

### Gates open/description
1 gate – A small surfable wave, suitable for beginners. Just before the weir closes completely, spinning and elevated moves are possible.

2 gates – A nice clean wave next to the wall, flanked to one side by a nice hole.

3 gates – A big wave with curling shoulders both sides, flanked by two amazing holes. At this level Hurley is world class.

4 gates – A series of linked holes (in addition to the hole which appears once more than 2 gates are open).
